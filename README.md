## Visualizations



## Observations

Taking into account a first analysis and observing the dataset we can reach the following premises about the possible hypothesis.

- The ticket prices vary significantly between Economy and Business class, with one class having higher average ticket prices than the other.

  - Objective: Explore and assert a significant difference in average ticket prices between Economy and Business class within the airline industry.


- The ticket prices significantly vary depending on the departure and arrival times.

  - Objective: Understand whether specific times of the day contribute to variations in ticket pricing within the context of the airline industry.


- There is a significant correlation between the number of stops and ticket prices.

  - Objective: Determine if there is a significant correlation between the number of stops and ticket prices, aiming to understand if travel convenience influences variations in ticket pricing.

- The duration of the flight significantly impacts ticket prices, indicating a noticeable difference in average ticket prices based on varying flight durations.

  - Objective: Explore how the duration of the flight impacts ticket prices, with the goal of understanding how time spent in transit contributes to variations in ticket pricing.

- The timing of ticket purchase significantly affects ticket prices.

  - Objective: Investigate whether the timing of ticket purchases significantly affects ticket prices, specifically exploring the impact of last-minute ticket purchases on variations in pricing.

- The source and destination significantly influence ticket prices, indicating a substantial difference in average ticket prices when the source and destination are changed.

  - Objective: Explore the influence of source and destination on ticket prices, aiming to understand if changes in these geographical factors contribute to substantial differences in ticket prices.
