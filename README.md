## Dataset selection

After examining various datasets from which a future model could be derived, we chose this one due to certain variables, such as the quantity of data it contains, around 53,940 rows where valuable information can be extracted. This substantial amount of data allows for a more profound, clear, and optimal analysis of the problem. Additionally, it is known that diamond prices pose a problem that affects people every day, creating economic difficulties, primarily focusing on individuals with the economic capacity to access these goods or entrepreneurs engaged in this business. Therefore, its impact on both the economy and the daily lives of people makes it a suitable dataset and problem to address. Similarly, the variables included in the dataset are well-known, easy to relate to when analyzing the problem, and the correlations found would facilitate the creation of our model. Finally, we consider that dealing with diamonds is not common, and for that reason, it seemed more interesting to us.

## Observations

Taking into account a first analysis and observing the dataset we can reach the following premises about the possible hypothesis.

**Market Trends:** |
- Observation: Explore market trends related to diamond prices over time, considering external factors such as economic conditions or industry changes.
- Objective: Identify and analyze trends in diamond prices, helping stakeholders make informed decisions based on the historical context.

**Regional Price Variations:**
Observation: Examine whether diamond prices vary regionally, considering factors like demand, local preferences, and economic disparities.
Objective: Determine regional variations in diamond prices, providing insights into market dynamics across different geographic areas.

**Brand Influence:**
Observation: Investigate whether specific diamond brands or certifications impact prices, reflecting consumer preferences for certain brands.
Objective: Understand the influence of brands on diamond prices and assess the role of brand reputation in the market.

**Emerging Diamond Trends:**
Observation: Keep an eye on emerging trends in the diamond industry, such as the popularity of certain cuts, colors, or ethical considerations.
Objective: Stay informed about evolving industry trends to anticipate shifts in consumer preferences and market demands.

**Consumer Demographics:**
Observation: Analyze whether the demographic characteristics of consumers, such as age, income, or cultural background, influence diamond preferences and prices.
Objective: Gain insights into the demographic factors shaping the diamond market, allowing for targeted marketing strategies and product offerings.

**Online vs. In-Store Purchases:**
Observation: Explore whether there are significant price differences between diamonds purchased online and those bought in physical stores.
Objective: Understand the impact of the purchasing medium on diamond prices, catering to the evolving trends in consumer buying behavior.

**Environmental Impact Considerations:**
Observation: Assess whether increasing awareness of environmental impact and ethical sourcing influences consumer choices and, subsequently, diamond prices.
Objective: Examine the correlation between environmental considerations, ethical sourcing practices, and their effects on diamond prices in the market.

## hypothesis

Taking into account various observations, it is necessary to highlight the initial hypothesis that the working team has about the dataset. Diamond prices do not depend solely on a particular variable; instead, they are determined and influenced by multiple variables, such as each of the different dimensions and weight, which collectively impact the price. This is the hypothesis we will be developing throughout the model with the objective of identifying which variables have a greater influence on diamond prices and in what manner.
